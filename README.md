This GitHub repository was created to store and organize the code I've produced during my coding competitions. It contains solutions and implementations for various programming problems encountered during these competitions.

# Code Organization
The code is logically organized using folders and meaningful file names. Each folder represents a specific competition or problem, while the files contain the corresponding solutions. File names are chosen to be descriptive and informative, making it easier to search and understand the code.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have improvements or optimized solutions for existing problems, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to coding standards, include appropriate tests, and document any changes or additions.

# Note
Please note that the solutions provided in this repository were developed during coding competitions where time was limited. Therefore, they may not represent the best coding practices or the most optimal solutions. However, they can serve as a reference or starting point when approaching similar problems.
